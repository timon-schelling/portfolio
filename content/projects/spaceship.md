Spaceship, a typical top down scroller space game and was one of my first mobile apps that is still up. I didn't use a game engine, just plain android APIs from 2016. I think the experience is still somewhat presentable, but my sense of clean code at the age of 14 was still lacking, therefore no code, sorry.
